PoetryScraper
=============

I'm trying to scrape websites with poetry. However, I am finding the Internet full of bullshit. Also it's like these poetry websites never bothered with hiring designers who use CSS. UGH.

The eventual goal is to build a (computational) taxonomy of English poetry according to theme and emotion. Let me know if this interests you.
